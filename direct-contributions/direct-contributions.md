# Direct Contributions to OSS

Programs where students contribute to existing open source codebases involve extensive engagement with communities of OSS contributors. By working on software used and maintained by the public, students can connect with other developers, learn about professional software engineering, and gain a sense of achievement from giving back to the community [^fn1].
