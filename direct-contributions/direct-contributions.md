# Direct Contributions to OSS

Programs where students contribute to existing open source code-bases involve the most amount of engagement with the real-worldOSS communities. By interacting with effective software used and maintained by the public, students can connect with other con-tributors, learn about open source development, and gain a sense of achievement from giving back to the community [^fn1].
