# Challenges & Questions

### How can instructors find suitable projects easily?
* Explore various OSS and determine which set of criteria best suits classroom needs
* Filter code repositories by language, software size, number of issues, etc.
* Browse compiled lists of suggested OSS communities
  * [Here is our collection of resources](https://deternitydx.github.io/oss-cs-classroom/direct-contributions/resources.html)
* Reference courses from other institutions that implement OSS projects
* Suggested readings: 
  * [Selecting open source software projects to teach software engineering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2538862.2538932)
  * [Integrating open source software into software engineering curriculum: challenges in selecting projects](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2663678.2663681)
  * [An approach for evaluating FOSS projects for student participation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2157136.2157260)

### Should instructors coordinate with OSS communities and project managers?
* If community members are willing to help, yes!
* Instructors can define expectations and project requirements with project managers to avoid overwhelming students and other contributors
* Suggested reading: 
  * [From the manager's perspective: Classroom contributions to open-source projects](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/FIE.2011.6143028)

### Should instructors dedicate time to teach software development tools in CS2?
* [ACM](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations) recommends teaching basic software engineering principles in introductory CS classes
* But teaching how to use version control systems and navigate code repositories may divert focus from the core curriculum and students may be overwhelmed by those tools
* If students are not experienced in software development, projects involving direct contributions to OSS are not recommended

### How should student work be graded?
* Awarding points based on whether students' pull requests are accepted by the community may be unfair since some OSS requires a long time to review changes
* Instead, implement checkpoints to assess students' understanding of their work, assigned OSS code base, CS2 concepts they applied, etc. in the form of write-ups or reports

### Should students download and build the entire OSS?
* If their assigned software is lightweight and doesn't require too many additional libraries to be installed, students can run/debug code on their local machines
* Otherwise, instructors can act as an intermediary between students and OSS
  * They can set up their own software build and test students' work

### Should students be expected to understand the entire OSS?
* If the code base is small and simple, students can benefit from analyzing how real-world software is implemented
* Otherwise, instructors can identify relevant components to help students grasp a general understanding of the overall architecture
