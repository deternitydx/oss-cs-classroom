# Custom Plug-ins for OSS

Relying on an external community of contributors as part of course projects can obstruct the class schedule if project managers are slow to assign tasks, provide feedback, review pull requests, or merge changes. Instead, students can build extensions that will work on top of existing OSS. They will be able to learn from software functioning in the real world without having to work with complicated, sometimes bureaucratic, development workflows. Furthermore, they do not need to understand the entire codebase if there are APIs and sufficient documentation available. Students will be able to brainstorm creative ideas for their plug-ins while staying within the boundary of their technical expertise and practicing course concepts. Unlike direct contributions to OSS, instructors will not have to scour the web for suitable projects for each student.
