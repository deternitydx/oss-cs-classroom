# Integrating Open Source Software in CS2 Classrooms

This a repository hosting our suggestions for using OSS in the CS2 classroom.

We introduce four models of incorporating OSS project principles, practices, and tools in decreasing degree of engagement with open source communities. They are [Direct Contributions to OSS](https://deternitydx.github.io/oss-cs-classroom/direct-contributions), [Custom Plug-ins for OSS](https://deternitydx.github.io/oss-cs-classroom/custom-plugins), [Simulations of Open Source Community](https://deternitydx.github.io/oss-cs-classroom/simulated-communities), and [OSS Code Snippets as Examples](https://deternitydx.github.io/oss-cs-classroom/code-snippets). Depending on the number of students, prior experience with software development, and the level of commitment by the instructor, choosing the most suitable model will ensure classroom success.
