# Sample Curriculum

## Tasks for Instructors

### 1. Identify host platform
You can use GitHub Classroom, GitLab, or similar platforms so that students can share and maintain their projects online.

### 2. Create a rubric for student projects
Define project requirements so that students can illustrate CS2 concepts with creative software.
* Which CS principles must be demonstrated in student applications?

### 3. Support students throughout the project
Developing software from scratch can be overwhelming for students. Provide resources to help them succeed.
* Which resources and tutorials can help students build practical applications?
* What kind of checkpoints can be assigned to make sure students are making progress?

## Tasks for Students

### 1. Design project
Brainstorm project ideas and formulate an outline of your application. Create a design document to discuss how you will utilize specific CS2 concepts within your code.
* What kind of applications can you build by applying CS2 knowledge?
* What will the software architecture look like?

### 2. Develop software
Build your application and write tests to validate each feature or component. Write user manuals and documentation to help others install and make contributions to your application.
* How can users install and utilize the plug-in?
* How do the different components of your code work together?

### 3. Explore other students' projects
Review classmates' software and discover various applications of CS principles. Analyze the features, functionalities, and structures of their projects.
* What is easy or difficult to understand and use about the software?
* How can it be improved?

### 4. Contribute to classmates' projects
Identify bugs and brainstorm new features that can be added to improve other projects. Just like OSS developers, make contributions and review software.
* What kind of modifications will you make?
* How will the rest of the software be affected by your changes?
* What kind of comments or documentation must be added/modified?
* What kind of tests can you write?
