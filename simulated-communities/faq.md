# Challenges & Questions

### How can instructors find suitable project ideas easily?
* Students should be encouraged to exercise their creativity and brainstorm ideas according to their interests
* Browse compiled lists of software ideas
  * [Here is our collection of resources](https://deternitydx.github.io/oss-cs-classroom/simulated-communities/resources.html)

### How can a classroom community simulate an OSS development environment?
* After building their applications, students will assume the role of OSS developers and contribute to each other's work
* Like project managers, they can review contributions to their own software and merge them
* Student projects can be published online with an open source license to encourage other novice programmers to contribute to and learn from
* Students can be better prepared and motivated to contribute to existing OSS outside of the course

### How should projects be graded?
* Instructors can verify whether students have applied CS2 concepts into their projects
* They can also grade documentation to check students' understanding of their code
