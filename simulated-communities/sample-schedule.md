# Sample Schedule


- Identification of suitable platform to host projects: 
  Instructors should either find, or build, a platform that enables them to monitor and manage student projects.  
- Brainstorm project ideas: 
  Both students and instructors can propose project ideas, and the final decision must be approved by the instructors, considering the feasibility of the project. Planning the overall structure, timeline, and related CS2 concepts of the project is preferred at the beginning of the class. 
- Contribution to other students' code: 
  Students can identify areas in other students' projects that need improvement, and they should try to understand the purpose, features, functionalities, requirements, and dependencies of the project to contribute to. 
- Examination of contributions made within the class community: 
  Instructors should provide detailed grading rubrics for the both building the projects (along with the documents) and contribution made to others' projects.
