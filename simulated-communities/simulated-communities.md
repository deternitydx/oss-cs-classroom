# Simulations of Open Source Communities

To reduce the uncertainty of the interactions between students and real-world programmers and codebases, and the burden of instructors when implementing the two approaches above, having students contribute to projects in a similar environment within class may provide a more comfortable learning experience for the students. Without the pressure and anxiety of directly contributing to the public OSS projects, students should have less fear to make mistakes and explore different options in their code. This is beneficial for students to practice programming logic and proficiency, and it also enables instructors to select appropriate topics that are more suitable for CS2 students. To foster the simulation of the OSS community, we recommend instructors utilize GitHub Classroom {cite}, or something similar, an educational tool with GitHub API that helps instructors manage and track class assignments. Inside the class setting of OSS community, students can review and contribute to each other's code, and instructors can choose to recycle the project ideas for future use with the visibility feature of GitHub Classroom, which no outside users or organizations can view the projects inside a GitHub Classroom. We could also do this with internal servers, such as using Gitlab.
