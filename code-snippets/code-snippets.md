# Code Snippets from OSS

Our last proposal of getting involved with OSS community does not necessitate student contribution. Instead, students could look at source files from OSS projects in the projects they are interested in, and find the chunk of codes inside that are good or bad examples of a classroom concept. Similarly, instructors could also demonstrate how certain CS topics are being used in the real-life code in their lectures. This does not stop students from learning about OSS-related topics and tools in the classroom, and instructors could still make contributing to the project an extra credit assignment for the students.
