# Code Snippets from OSS

This model of incorporating OSS into classrooms does not necessitate student contributions. Instead, instructors can integrate selected OSS code snippets into lectures as real-life examples of textbook concepts. To aid the search for relevant applications, de França Tonhão et al. [^fn1] provide an [online repository](https://portalworkedexamples.000webhostapp.com/) with deconstructed software solutions that demonstrate CS concepts. Alternatively, more interactive strategies can be employed to engage students. For example, students can examine source codes of various OSS and analyze components that illustrate specific topics. Instructors can also extract parts of OSS and adopt them as homework assignments or programming exercises.
