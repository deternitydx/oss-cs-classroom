# Sample Schedule

- Identification of CS2 concepts with OSS projects: 
  Instructors could focus on finding OSS code snippets from application domain that interests students the most to showcase in the lecture, or have students to explore OSS projects freely, for example, by assigning homework and lab exercises.
- Demonstration of good and bad examples from OSS snippets: 
  Instructors could think about how these code snippets help students comprehend the course concepts better, and how they benefit students' learning to program using similar concepts. In the illustration of the code snippets, instructors could bring in ideas of OSS to introduce to students how programmers user certain concepts in the real world. 
- Examination of students' understanding of the material: 
  Instructors should try to evaluate how the utilization of these code snippets serves as a tool to aid the delivery of the course concepts. Since there are numerous ways to implement the actual model, the ways to examine vary as well.
